# What is this?

This is year end statistics for Plurk. Yes, some people still using Plurk.

I made this in my spare time to see my own year end statistics for my Plurk timeline.

## What should I do first?

1. Install node.js + npm.
2. Open terminal and run `npm update` in the repo folder. Make sure everything is up to date.
3. If you haven't, register your own to plurk app: `https://www.plurk.com/PlurkApp/register`
4. Open src/plurk-api.php then change `$conskey` for your app key and  `$conssec` for your app secret.
5. Run `gulp` to start the server and automatic source code compressing process. It will also open the url in your browser automagically.
6. If everything goes well, you should able to see the login page in your browser.

## I want to change stuff, which file should I observe?

1. There is `js/src/app/replurk.js` where I put all the logic and functionality.
2. There is `also src/index.php` if you want to change the HTML page.
3. You can also find `css/src/main.css` for the main stylesheet and `css/src/horizontal-screen.css` + `css/src/horizontal-screen.css` for respected screen aspect ratio spesific stylesheets.
